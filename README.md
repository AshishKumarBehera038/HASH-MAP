# HASH-MAP
Hash Map coding using Python

Ok Guys I have given my code in this Github page.
Be sure to properly view and understand the code.

For understanding the ASCII value, I have given the link to the ASCII table i.e https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.htm You can see the third and fourth column contain ASCII value for the Uppercase and Lowercase of English Alphabets.
